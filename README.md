## 🚀 Double-Entry Validation System

The ledger now includes **enterprise-grade automatic double-entry validation**:

### ✅ **Validation Features**
- **Balance Verification**: Automatic check that debits equal credits
- **Account Validation**: Ensures all accounts exist and are active
- **Precision Handling**: Proper decimal arithmetic for monetary calculations
- **Business Logic**: Multi-line transaction support with complex journal entries
- **Accounting Equation**: Maintains Assets = Liabilities + Equity integrity

### 🔍 **New API Endpoints**
- `POST /api/v1/transactions/validate` - Validate transaction before creation
- `GET /api/v1/transactions/{id}/validate` - Verify existing transaction integrity
- `GET /api/v1/transactions/system/validate-all` - System-wide audit validation
- `GET /api/v1/transactions/system/accounting-equation` - Real-time equation status

### 📊 **Financial Reporting API**
- `GET /api/v1/reports/trial-balance` - Trial Balance with account balances
- `GET /api/v1/reports/balance-sheet` - Balance Sheet (Assets = Liabilities + Equity)
- `GET /api/v1/reports/income-statement` - Income Statement (P&L) for period analysis
- `GET /api/v1/reports/general-ledger` - General Ledger with transaction details
- `GET /api/v1/reports/cash-flow` - Cash Flow Statement tracking liquidity
- `GET /api/v1/reports/dashboard` - Comprehensive financial dashboard

### 🛡️ **Database Constraints**
- Positive amounts only (`amount > 0`)
- Valid transaction types (`debit` or `credit`)
- Foreign key integrity for accounts and transactions
- Cascade deletion for transaction lines

## Getting Started

### 1. Database (PostgreSQL)

We use PostgreSQL as a Docker container.  
You can start the database (and pgAdmin) using Docker Compose:

```sh
cd db
docker compose up -d
```

This will start:
- PostgreSQL (`mguser`/`mgpassword`, database: `mgledger`)
- pgAdmin (web UI at http://localhost:8088, login: `user@mgdonlinestore.com` / `password`)

To connect in pgAdmin, use:
- Host: `postgres`
- Port: `5432`
- Username: `mguser`
- Password: `mgpassword`
- Database: `mgledger`

If you want to run the database manually (not recommended if using Docker Compose):

```sh
docker run --name mg-erp-postgres -e POSTGRES_USER=mguser -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mgpassword -e POSTGRES_DB=mgledger -v mg-erp-pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data -p 5432:5432 -d postgres:15
```

---

### 2. Backend (FastAPI)

```sh
cd backend
py -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd app
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

- The backend expects the database to be running and accessible.
- By default, it connects to `localhost:5432` (see `backend/app/config.py`).
- If running inside Docker Compose, set `DATABASE_URL` to use `postgres` as the host.

---

### 3. Frontend (React + TypeScript)

```sh
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

- The frontend will start on http://localhost:5173 (the exact URL will be printed in the CMD after run the command !) and interact with the backend API.

## 📋 API Examples

```bash
# Example: Sales transaction with automatic validation
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/transactions" \

## Environment Variables

You can override the backend database connection by creating a `.env` file in `backend/app/`:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://mguser:mgpassword@localhost/mgledger
```

If running backend inside Docker Compose, use:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://mguser:mgpassword@postgres/mgledger
```

## Notes

- Make sure the database is running before starting the backend.
- If you change database credentials, update them everywhere and restart containers.
- For first-time setup or after changing DB credentials, you may need to remove the Docker volume:  
  `docker compose down -v && docker compose up -d`
